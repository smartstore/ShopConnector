## Smartstore Shop-Connector

This repository contains the Shop-Connector plugin for [Smartstore](https://github.com/smartstore/SmartStoreNET). It allows any number of Smartstore shops to be directly connected to each other in order 
to exchange catalog data such as products and categories. Shops can act both as data providers and data receivers. Therefore only the shop URL and access keys have to be stored in the plugin configuration.
The data exchange takes place in two steps. First the desired data is retrieved from the data provider and stored on the data receivers' server. In the second step the data can be imported by using several options.
